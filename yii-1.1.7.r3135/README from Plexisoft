Please, note that this version of Yii framework has been customized by us.
To find all changes just read docs AND/OR compare it with original code in "distr" folder.

============================

CClientScript.php file was completely replaced with the same file from the distr yii-1.1.13.e9e4a0.
It was done after integrating into our project Imperavi Yii widget that requires some new methods of CClientScript.

After that it was found this class uses a more new version of jQuery.
That's why web/js folder was replaced with the same folder from the distr yii-1.1.13.e9e4a0.
The old folder was saved under the name web/js.old.

=============================

CJavascriptExpression was copied from the distr yii-1.1.13.e9e4a0.
It did not exist in the used version.

CJavaScript file was replaced with newer version too to make correct encoding of CJavascriptExpression.

This file was required for yiichat extension that we tested for the possibility of using it as helpdesk livechat.

=============================
!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In the process of implementing previous changes it was found that yii-1.1.13.e9e4a0 is probably the last version of yii 1.1, and further 2.0 version will not be compatible with the previous releases.

That's why I'm not sure that we will ever need upgrade to 2.0 because it may be too time-consuming.
And if you will ever think about upgrade you will need to upgrade to yii-1.1.13.e9e4a0 only.

=============================

CSecurityManager.php was replaced with the same file in Version 1.1.15. 
In new version, there is a method called generateRandomString() which we used in Customer.php on frontend app.
